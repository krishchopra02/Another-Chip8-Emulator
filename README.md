# Another-Chip8-Emulator
A Chip-8 emulator (nothing novel) written in Rust. The following references (smiles) were used to write the emulator: 

* [Cowgod's Chip-8 Documentation](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
* [Austin Morlan's Guide to Chip-8 emulator](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/)

# SDL2 
Sdl 2 needs to be installed in the system for running this code. Install it if you want to run this (better off really running any other emulator that does not make you download extra stuff).
